  <h1>Seamline — Terms & Conditions</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated: 22 September 2025</strong></p>
  <p>By participating in Seamline, you agree to the legally binding terms below. If anything here conflicts with a separately signed agreement, that signed agreement controls.</p>

  <h2>1. Photo Consent & Release</h2>
  <p> I, grant Seamline, its affiliates, successors, licensees, assigns, any future entity operating under a different name or brand identity, and any approved affiliates such as partner universities or institutions formally authorized by Seamline’s board of directors (collectively “Seamline”), the irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide, and unrestricted right to photograph, record, and/or otherwise capture my image, likeness, shop, property, or business premises (the “Photos”), and to use, publish, reproduce, display, distribute, license, sell, and otherwise exploit the Photos in any medium now known or later developed, for any purpose whatsoever, including but not limited to uses in the Seamline app, website, social media, advertising, marketing, editorial, internal documentation, or other uses approved by Seamline’s board of directors or its authorized affiliates.</p>

  <h2>2. Commercial Use</h2>
  <p>Seamline may use the Photos for commercial purposes, including advertising, app monetisation, marketing campaigns, sponsorships, licensing, merchandising, or other business activities.</p>
  <p>I acknowledge that I will not receive compensation, royalties, or profit share from Seamline’s use of the Photos, whether revenues are generated solely from the Photos or in combination with other products or services. Any compensation would only be enforceable if set out in a separate written agreement signed by both parties.</p>

  <h2>4. Optional Discussion</h2>
  <p>If I wish to discuss potential compensation, I must contact the current director of Seamline to request a meeting. I understand that requesting or attending such a meeting does not, on its own, entitle me to any compensation. Any arrangement regarding compensation is only valid if a formal, mutual agreement has been documented in writing and signed by both parties. Without such a signed agreement, no rights to compensation exist.</p>

  <h2>5. Social Media & Public Use</h2>
  <p>The Photos may appear on Seamline’s official social media accounts, websites, press materials, print publications, and other channels without limitation.</p>

  <h2>6. Editing & Derivatives</h2>
  <p>Seamline may crop, edit, alter, adapt, combine, or otherwise modify the Photos without further approval from me.</p>

  <h2>7. Other Approved Uses</h2>
  <p>The Photos may also be used in projects, partnerships, collaborations, or contexts approved by Seamline’s board of directors or by its formally authorized affiliates (including universities and educational partners).</p>

  <h2>8. Ownership</h2>
  <p>All rights, title, and interest in the Photos (including intellectual property rights) belong exclusively to Seamline, and I hereby assign to Seamline any rights I may have in the Photos.</p>

  <h2>9. Withdrawal & Changes</h2>
  <p>I may withdraw this consent or request changes only by giving Seamline written notice with reasonable advance time to process the request. I understand and acknowledge that if I withdraw consent or seek to change these terms, Seamline has the full right to remove my shop, property, or listing from its platform, app, website, and related materials without liability or obligation. Seamline is not required to recall, remove, or destroy materials already published, distributed, or licensed prior to receipt of such written withdrawal or request. I waive any right to rescind or revoke this release as to any prior use of the Photos.</p>

  <h2>10. No Obligation to Use</h2>
  <p>Seamline is not obligated to use the Photos and may decide, at its sole discretion, whether or not to include them in its platforms, materials, or campaigns.</p>

  <h2>11. Authority to Sign</h2>
  <p>If I am signing on behalf of a shop, business, or other entity, I represent and warrant that I have full authority to grant this release on its behalf.</p>

  <h2>12. Shop’s Ethical Commitment</h2>
  <p>By signing this release, I confirm that my shop and/or business does not profit from slavery, forced labour, human trafficking, or other exploitative practices, and that I am committed to fair, sustainable, and ethical business conduct in relation to the goods and services I provide. Seamline reserves the right to delist my shop from its platforms if this commitment is breached.</p>

  <h2>13. Release & Waiver</h2>
  <p>I release and discharge Seamline, its employees, agents, directors, successors, affiliates, and assigns from all claims or liabilities relating to the use of the Photos, including but not limited to claims for defamation, false light, invasion of privacy, right of publicity, infringement of moral rights, or reputational harm.</p>

  <h2>14. Moral Rights Waiver</h2>
  <p>I expressly waive any moral rights I may have in the Photos, including the right to be identified and the right to object to modification, distortion, or contextual use.</p>

  <h2>15. No Injunctive Relief</h2>
  <p>I agree not to seek injunctive or equitable relief to prevent or restrict Seamline’s use of the Photos; any claim shall be limited to monetary damages (if applicable).</p>

  <h2>16. Indemnification</h2>
  <p>I agree to indemnify and hold Seamline harmless from any losses, claims, or liabilities (including legal fees) arising out of any false representations made in this release or from third-party claims related to the Photos.</p>

  <h2>17. Third-Party Claims Waiver</h2>
  <p>I waive any claims on behalf of third parties who may appear in or be connected to the Photos.</p>

  <h2>18. Contextual Use</h2>
  <p>I waive any claims arising from the Photos being combined with other text, images, or media, or being used in a particular context.</p>

  <h2>19. Data Protection</h2>
  <p>Seamline will collect and store the Photos and personal information provided in this form (including name, contact details, and signature) for the purposes of administering this release and maintaining records. Data will be stored securely and processed in compliance with applicable data protection laws, including the UK GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018.</p>

  <h2>20. Severability</h2>
  <p>If any provision of this release is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.</p>

  <h2>21. Governing Law</h2>
  <p>This release shall be governed by and construed under the laws of England & Wales, and the courts of England shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any disputes arising from it.</p>
